            A deteriorated breed,
a portent of
the end times,
or a vampire for a brave new
world? Balancing at the midpoint
between life and death, the everchanging nature of the Duskborn
evokes pity, jealousy, and fear in equal
measure. Survivors of the last decades of
pogroms, prejudice, and ostracization, the
thin-blooded are here to stay. Their messy
street-alchemy and ability to pass as human
makes them uniquely suited to thrive outside
Kindred society and make their own fate in the
post-modern nights.

        <h2>
            Who Are the
Thin-Blooded?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sires tell their childer of the 13th and 14th generation
            never to attempt the Embrace as their Blood is too far
            removed from Caine. They say it will bring nothing but
            death and sorrow. But, be it by mistake or design, this
            edict is not always followed.
            <br/>
            A 14th generation Kindred, who only by miracle
            avoided the flaw of thin blood themselves, drain a mortal in a fit of frenzy and guiltily feed them a mouthful of
            vitae, hoping against hope that it might reanimate the
            broken body.
            <br/>
            A Ventrue from a long line of liars thinks herself
            closer to her progenitor than she really is, and believes
            she is creating a worthy member for her clan.
            <br/>
            A prince’s great-grandchilde attempts to force their
            diluted vitae into the mouth of their ancestor’s executed,
            treacherous ghoul just to get back at the old tyrant.
            <br/>
            A Tremere, often overlooked by his clan for his
            weakness of Blood and spirit, experiments with the
            Embrace to prove himself as good as them.
            <br/>
            In all these cases, a dusk-born may awaken, if the
            Blood wills it.
            <br/>
            Kindred who intend to sire thin-bloods often target
            individuals they already have a pre-existing relationship
            with, such as a trusted ghoul or a human family member
            they cannot forget, or they seek out vessels who demonstrate specific traits or rare talents that make them
            better equipped to survive as the weakest of predators.
            Many Kindred view the thin-bloods as a threat to the
            Masquerade and will destroy them, if given the chance.
            <br/>
            The thin-blooded can be of any mortal origin and
            are not affected by their parent clan’s curse nor by their
            preferences in the same degree as their sire. If they are
            allowed to rise, they will likely be turned away, gaining
            the luxury of freedom and the danger of solitude.
            <br/>
            In 2009 the Inner Circle of the Camarilla issued
            an edict that all thin-blooded must be branded or
            tattooed with the “mark of the crescent moon”. Inked
            by a Tremere tattoo artist or scorched with a beam of
            sunlight, the brand is irreversible. Even Anarchs and
            unbound think twice before associating with a marked
            Mercurian.

        <h3>Thin-Blood Archetypes</h3>
        <h4>
            live one
        </h4>
        <p>
            This thin-blood is deeply connected to the mortal world, perhaps more so than the Kindred one. They
            still maintain a family and attempt to hold a job; paying the bills is more important than the whim of some
            baron they have never met. Ironically, to maintain
            their human façade, they likely have to lean heavily on
            the powers in their Blood.
        </p>
        <h4>
            weapon of convenience
        </h4>
        <p>
            A former occultist, ghoul, or blood doll, they were
close to the Kindred before joining their ranks and
knew some of their secrets. This thin-blood was Embraced out of their sire’s desperation when backed into
a corner, and they were meant to take part in some war
or pursue a vengeful dream. Whether they choose to
do so or not is up to them. The Embrace released them
from their former slavery, and now there is nothing
forcing them to do their sire’s bidding.
        </p>
        <h4>
            guilty embrace
        </h4>
        <p>
            This thin-blood was not Embraced as part of some
elaborate plan. A party-goer, a late-night worker walking home alone, or just someone in the wrong place at
the wrong time – a vampire fed from them and drank
a little too much. Perhaps the Embrace was performed
by the drinker as an act of desperate guilt, or perhaps
their sire was an onlooker who couldn’t bear to watch
them die.
        </p>
        <h4>
            natural vampire
        </h4>
        <p>
            This thin-blood was destined to become one of the
Kindred. As a mortal hunter or a member of Arcanum,
they studied the lore of the clans and the myth of
Caine and became too fascinated for their own good.
Meaning to kill, question, or request the Embrace, they
tracked down one of the Kindred. But their sire was a
not what was expected by the childe, who is now bitter
at the weakness in their veins.
        </p>
        <h4>
            redemption seeker
        </h4>
        <p>
            This thin-blood was turned against their will and
refuses to accept a place in a world of streetlights and
blood. They are recently turned and desperately look
for a way to cure their “condition,” seeking out rumors
of others who have done it as well as weird legends
of Golconda and blood transfusions. There is indeed
a way, but before they figure it out this thin-blood
will try anything and is easy to manipulate by callous
Kindred.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Blood Chemist
        </h4>
        <p>
            In their previous life, the Blood Chemist concocted
designer drugs, seeking different types of chemical
romance or psychedelic highs. With their newfound
Embrace, they shifted interest from drugs to
different Thin-Blood Alchemy formulae. They keep
one foot in the fancy drug scene to make money
— and to score potentially game-changing new
ingredients for potentially world-changing formulae.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Caretaker
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Caretaker takes it upon themselves to help others
in dire situations, both the newly Embraced and the
generally outcast. They help provide shelter, blood, and
knowledge around their very survival. Community and
family are important to them, and they try to build up
their resources to help those in their care, protecting
and nurturing whatever way they can. Some Caretakers
commit an awful lot of what looks like mayhem in the
name of charity and community.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Paranormalist
        </h4>
        <p>
            If vampires exist, then what else is out there?
The Paranormalist eagerly investigates this world
of darkness they have awakened into, gathering
information and making contacts with any and
all supernatural contactees or, better yet, with
supernatural beings. They don’t know (or care)
about ancient rivalries; what matters is filling in their
knowledge and stunting on their rival cryptid-hunters
and conspiracy theorists on 4chan. The Paranormalist
leaves a trail behind them, but normies (and older
Kindred) find it too baffling (and ridiculous) to
follow. Until the Paranormalist stumbles onto a real
secret, of course …
        </p>
        <h4>
            Street Rat
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Street Rat may not realize what they are, instead
attributing it to some lousy drug trip, medical
ailment left untreated, or even a bad dream. They
scavenge around, looking for trinkets, valuable
items, or discarded valuables that could earn them
some cash. The Rat gets good at pick-pocketing,
begging, and becoming invisible when needed, or
the Rat gets eaten.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Sun Seeker
        </h4>
        <p>
            This thin-blood doesn’t seek to change their
vampiric state. Instead, they want to develop a way
to experience the sun without losing their vampiric
powers. The Sun Seeker may try to convince the
Bahari cult (Vampire: The Masquerade, p. 382)
to accept them as fellow seekers, but the Lilin don’t
accept thin-bloods easily. The solution: find some
artifact, tome, method, or ritual that the Bahari need
for their own purposes and come to an arrangement
that may benefit all Duskborn.

        <h2>Thin-Blood Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            A thin-blood is created when a 13th or higher generation vampire Embraces a mortal. While formally
belonging to the 14th, 15th, or even 16th generation,
these classifications mean nothing to the thinbloods, as they exhibit a wide variety of traits with
no connection to their supposed generation. A 14th
generation thin-blood may be too weak to even
Blood Bond with a mortal, while a 15th might still
retain the ability to Embrace, and vice versa. Among
the dusk-born, the lines are blurred.
<br/>
Despite this, your thin-blood character is still
fundamentally a vampire, and unless otherwise stated
follows the same rules as other vampires in this book.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Blood
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thin-bloods cannot create Blood Bonds or perform the
Embrace with any certainty. A Rouse Check worth of
thin-blood vitae imbues a mortal with ghoul-like powers, but only for a single night.
Thin-bloods always have Blood Potency 0 (see p.
215).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Clan
        </h3>
        <p>
            A thin-blood is always considered clanless and never
suffers any specific clan bane or compulsion.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Damage
        </h3>
        <p>
            Most thin-bloods sustain damage like mortals but
mend like vampires. In game terms, they take Aggravated damage not only from fire, but also from slashing
and piercing weapons. Impalement with a stake does
not paralyze them but instead causes massive physical
trauma, likely sending them into torpor. Once damaged, thin-bloods heal according to the rules for other
vampires.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Disciplines
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thin-bloods pioneered and practice
the art of thin-blood alchemy. This
potentially allows them to taste the
Disciplines of other Kindred … and
to get more than a taste if they can
find the vitae to fuel those workings.
<br/>
Additionally, whenever a thinblood feeds they gain one dot in
one Discipline associated with the
Resonance of the blood consumed,
together with one level one power
in that discipline. If the Resonance
is Intense or stronger, they gain
an additional dot together with a
second power. No additional powers
can be gained in this way nor can the
rating increase with experience. This
Discipline lasts until Hunger reaches
5 or the next feeding.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Hunger and Frenzy
        </h3>
        <p>
A thin-blood suffers hunger just as
any vampire. However, the Beast
is far less overt, and a thin-blood
never frenzies unless provoked by
supernatural means (such as Animalism, p. 244).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Life-Like
        </h3>
        <p>
            A thin-blood always counts as having used Blush of Life (se p. 218),
the exact effects dependant on
their Humanity rating.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Sunlight
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thin-bloods take only one level
of Superficial damage per turn in
direct sunlight. Less direct sunlight
causes damage with less frequency.
For example, under heavy clouds
or if masked and protected by
clothing or thick sunscreen, the
thin-blood might only sustain
damage every third turn or once
per minute.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Thin-Blood Merits
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thin-bloods often display additional variations. See Thin-Blood
Merits and Flaws (p. 183) for
details.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Ways Out
        </h2>
        <p>
            Straddling the line between mortality and vampirism, thin-bloods
            have a choice. While they do not
            age, and can thus stay thin-bloods
            indefinitely, most of their kind
            sooner or later chooses the day
            or the night. A thin-blood who
            manages to commit diablerie on
            a “true” Kindred absorbs not only
            their power and spirit but also
            their lineage, turning them into a
            13th generation Kindred of their
            victim’s clan. The Camarilla occasionally dangles this prize in front
            of dusk-born who show themselves
            capable of running the dirtiest of
            errands and surviving, offering
            up a Cainite sentenced to a Blood
            Hunt as sacrifice.
            <br/>
            Conversely, every thin-blood
            knows someone who knows someone who returned to the daylight.
            The story usually goes that they
            became mortal again by clinging
            to their humanity until they could
            hunt down and end their sire, thus
            ending their curse.
            <br/>
            Of course, any mortal who
            knows about the Kindred is a threat
            to the Masquerade.
        </p>
        
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>
            Many Kindred despise thin-bloods as weak, or
actively hunt them as harbingers of end times. Many
elders did both, and their heirs see little reason to
depart from this tradition. The weaker ancillae
project their fear of their own weakness onto the
Duskborn, arguing that letting the thin-blooded
circulate through the streets weakens the city. Thinbloods use up valuable resources, and their growing
numbers attract Hunter attention. Also they don’t
know their place, and disrespect their betters.
Keeping them around poses an intolerable risk to
full-blooded, real vampires.
<br/>
Fuck that. You didn’t ask to be Embraced into
their shitty society, and you sure don’t need their
permission to stay. But if you’re going to take that
attitude, you need friends, or at least backup.
        </p>
        <h5>
            Players new to Vampire can benefit from playing an
all thin-blood chronicle. Thin-blood characters don’t
know any more about the world, or its history, or what
vampires can do, than you do! This outsider perspective
also allows players of older editions to painlessly reset
their expectations of this new millennium of darkness.
        </h5>
        <h2>
            The Thin-Blood Chronicle
        </h2>
        <p>
            An all thin-blood troupe engages with very different
elements than a predominantly full-blooded
Kindred chronicle. This chronicle style centers
stories on the nightly activities of thin-bloods, how
they exist in a world hostile to them, and where they
belong within that world.
<br/>
Thin-bloods spend their nights on the outskirts of
Kindred society, with doors rarely opening toward sect
membership unless the sect has something to gain.
Even within a sect, thin-bloods find an older talon on
the scales against them. The powers that be rarely allow
thin-bloods to feed in prime locations without facing
consequences, and when they can pioneer or nurture a
desirable piece of territory more powerful vampires chase
them out of it. Some thin-bloods seclude themselves in
neighborhoods nobody wants, or even drift to smaller
towns like the Caitiff did in the last centuries.
<br/>
The dynamics between thin-bloods also shift away
from more traditional organizations. Instead, they
tend to develop organically in each location, with
thin-bloods either keeping to themselves or taking
on roles needed within a city. Many thin-bloods keep
hidden away, their nights not much different from
when they were alive, while other thin-bloods reach
out, wanting to connect with similar vampires. Each
fledgling has their reason for doing so, leading to
many different interactions.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>
            Why Play a Thin-Blood Chronicle?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thin-blood characters have a very different perspective
on the world and the darkness it encapsulates. Thin 
bloods occupy a narrative sweet spot among the
supernatural horrors around them, just powerful
enough to attract their attention and weak enough
to always be in constant danger. They punctuate this
scramble for survival with mysterious pursuits and the
spark of Thin-Blood Alchemy offering a chance to get
their own back or at least to hold their own.
<br/>
A thin-blood chronicle has less of a high political
focus, because thin-bloods can’t easily navigate
the politics of city or sect. Coteries focus on their
nightly needs and short-term problems, rarely having
the resources or power to address long-term or
systemic issues that keep them down. The tone and
action shifts to back-alley, gritty, street-style stories
not tied down to rigid plots or the expectations
of Harpies or ideologists. Themes of teamwork,
uncertainty, and being outcast predominate, as
characters build their connections within their
coterie and out into their neighborhoods first before
engaging the larger world. Hunting and learning
to maximize one-dot powers against Kindred
opposition provide plenty of bloody challenges, as
does the occasional scourge or slayer.
<br/>
Some players may want to experiment with
different aspects of being a vampire. They may find
other clans more restrictive than being a thin-blood.
A thin-blood chronicle allows players to impact what
it means to be a vampire, allowing them to explore
things like Thin-Blood Alchemy, undeath, what
it means to be in touch with their Beast, and even
experimenting with sunlight. Running a thin-blood
chronicle allows players to adapt to their world with
fewer restrictions while still playing vampires.

        <h3>
            Organizing a Thin-Blood Chronicle
        </h3>
        <p>
            A troupe can consider several approaches to a thinblood chronicle when deciding what game style they
want to play. During session zero, the Storyteller and
players need to decide what type of story they want
to explore as a thin-blood troupe. Some questions to
think about are:
<ul>
    <li>
        What kind of supernatural horror would you like
        to encounter?
    </li>
    <li>
        Would your characters explore “curing” their
        vampirism?
    </li>
    <li>
        Do you feel like playing with high Kindred
        politics or low street action?
    </li>
    <li>
        How does your character approach Thin-Blood
        Alchemy?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is one goal your thin-blood character has?
    </li>
</ul>
This is not an exhaustive list, and you may find
other questions to ask along the way. Each player
should answer these as best as they can. Once the
Storyteller has a good idea of the characters and
how they view the world, they can determine the
direction they want to take with their chronicle.
        </p>
        <h5>
            The session where you decide which city your chronicle
takes place in, and make up characters, and establish
your table’s safety tools, and do all the other things you
do before you actually start the story going is called
session zero. (See Vampire: The Masquerade,
pp. 135–138.) Sometimes session zero takes more than
one session. That’s not a problem, you need a good
foundation before you put up a structure.

        <h3>
            Thin-Blood Story Hooks
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Storyteller and players should consider different
story hooks for the thin-bloods in their chronicle.
Use these story hooks to help bring a thin-blood
into a chronicle, add to a character background for
future intrigue, or to drop in during a story to help
cooperatively facilitate rich play.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You spent most of your vampiric unlife alone,
                secluded from other Kindred. However, you
                recently learned about several thin-bloods in your
                area who have wanted you to join them and work
                together for resources and survival. In addition,
                they are willing to teach you more about
                vampires and the world you now live in.</li>
            <li>You just made the worst discovery possible. After
                moving to another city, you learn the Camarilla is
                moving in to sweep the city of any vampires not
                acknowledged within the sect, destroying them on
                sight. You need to figure out where you are going
                to hide or if you are going to try and join the sect.
                If the latter, who do you turn into the scourges to
                prove your loyalty? </li>
            <li>You have contracted, or was born with, an
                unknown disease that makes you acutely allergic
                to sunlight and forces you to drink blood.
                Together with others afflicted in a similar way
                you are trying to find a cure, all the while hiding
                from human-like monsters with supernatural
                abilities and political connections hunting you
                for being what you are.</li>
            <li>You angered the wrong person, who put a curse
                upon you, taking away any potency you had
                with your blood. As a result, you find yourself
                among the thin-bloods now, scared, abandoned,
                and weak. You have no place in your former sect
                once you were found out and now must figure
                out how to survive or strengthen your blood
                once more.</li>

        <h3>
            Organization
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thin-bloods don’t have a centralized organization,
like some clans do. They have neither the shared,
ancestral resources to keep such groups safe, nor
the political capital to integrate them within larger
Kindred society. Instead, thin-blood assemble
themselves within each city, with the degree of
organization and the number of groups dependent
on local conditions. Almost all cities have at least one
thin-blood soviet or gang of self-radicalized Anarchs,
possibly even one recognized by the real Anarch
committee in town, but often isolated both politically
and geographically. A big city with a lot of thinbloods but a powerful Camarilla presence creates lots
of different small gangs and groups; a smaller city with
a power vacuum lets a larger network of Duskborn
emerge, only to factionalize itself within a few years.
<br/>
Within your city, some of these emerging nascent
groups might include:
        </p>
        <h4>
            Alchemist Posse
        </h4>
        <p>
            The city’s leading thin-blood
alchemist attracts a community of clients, fans, and
colleagues – and usually a rival or two with their
own posses. This scene resembles a cross between
cocktail culture and hip-hop club culture, following
mixers and AJs and occasionally beefing with bloody
results. Knowing someone in the posse generally gets
you put on the guest list and maybe even crash space.
        </p>
        <h4>
            The Basement 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Named after either its subreddit
r/BasementDrinkin or its dank headquarters, the
Basement fancies itself the information clearinghouse
of the local Duskborn and claims a national distributed
network of such groups. The word “blockchain” gets
tossed around a lot. Well-meaning thin-bloods tell the
Basement what they’ve learned about vampirism or
the supernatural or the local power structure, which
supposedly gets archived. Indeed, some of this lore gets
passed on to newcomers. Almost certainly penetrated
by other factions, if only with disinformation, the
Basement offers a standing invitation to both the NSA
and the Camarilla to destroy it or turn it.
        </p>
        <h4>
            The Folk
        </h4>
        <p>
            A loose mutual-aid commune, beginning
as an all-thin-blood Plumaire coterie within the furry
community but spreading throughout other fantasylife-themed meetup spaces. Most of the Folk organize
locally, keeping to one city or area, though a few
communicate across distances for safe travel. They
host traveling “family members,” giving a haven for
the day, providing them with vital information about
the city, and even blood if needed. In addition, they
share information when traveling, helping other Folk
to know what is going on with other thin-bloods in
other cities. To be a member of the Folk, all you need
to do is to connect with them in each city, help out
when needed, and be willing to identify yourself with
a hippie name like “The Folk.”
        </p>
        <h4>
            Mundies
        </h4>
        <p>
            The Mundies take their name from
Athanor Mundi, a radical alchemical manifesto
posted on Usenet by the anonymous “Philatheles
Doe” in the 1990s. Doe’s original goal was
to use Alchemy to fire all Cainites into a true
Philosopher’s Stone, gifting the world with eternal
life and freedom from disease and age. Since Doe’s
disappearance around 2002 the Mundie movement
splintered. Now Mundies generally believe that the
thin-bloods, at least, are bound to achieve a higher
state, possibly through alchemy, diablerie, or special
cocktails of blood and supplements. Mundie cliques
can be empty braggart gangs, amiable druggie coops in “Athanor Monday” shirts, or crafty lurkers
waiting to talk (or kidnap) another thin-blood into
experiments. Fortunately, they seldom cooperate,
each Mundie guru believing themselves to be the
natural Nietzschean ubervamp superior.

            Thin-Bloods and the Sects
        </h2>
        <p>
            Opinions might differ among the thin-bloods
regarding the different sects, but there is a consensus
among most of them. A singular thin-blood may
find themselves in a good position with one or more
of the sects, but not every Duskborn enjoys that
comfort. A lucky thin-blood who finds a teacher
will pass along this information, knowing they could
have a very different experience.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>
            Anarchs
        </h3>
        <p>
            <i>
                “We have more of a chance with the Anarchs than any
                other sect, to be honest. Most of them don’t ask many
                questions as long as we don’t cause a fuss. Though I
                think they might tolerate us simply out of spite.”
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Anarchs pushed back against the Camarilla
and took most of the Brujah and Gangrel with them,
many thin-bloods saw an opportunity to form a
relationship with the sect and gain the protection of
stronger-blooded Kindred. The Anarchs, in turn,
started working more with thin-bloods purely to spite
the Camarilla.
<br/>
If a thin-blood looks for the protection of an
organization, this is the one they likely secure the
most comfort in. A thin-blood gang could get
Anarch standing, or a thin-blood may accept Anarch
protection in exchange for a few favors. Thin-bloods
have better access to Anarch leadership, on the whole,
than in other sects. Anarchs often see themselves as
underdogs, and sympathize with thin-bloods for that
reason, but the practicalities of survival almost always
trump their allegiance to egalitarian ideals. Cainite
Anarchs still see the Duskborn as liabilities that drain
limited resources while contributing very little in the
way of raw power.
<br/>
The Anarchs accept the Duskborn more than does
the Camarilla, but they can count fangs better than
the Ivory Tower can, too. If thin-blood numbers grow
too great, the Anarchs become wary of their potential
influence and might even declare a purge or a rumble
to drop the ratio. Longer-term minded Barons aggressively recruit thin-bloods into particularly
dangerous coterie types such as a Day Watch.

        <h3>
            Camarilla
        </h3>
        <p>
            <i>
                “If I had to choose between any of the sects, the
Camarilla would be the last one on my list. These
elitist bastards make it their personal mission to make
our existence so miserable we end our own unlives.”
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Any thin-blood who travels to (or awakens in) a
Camarilla-controlled city needs to keep on their toes
to avoid being caught or introduce themselves to
the city’s Prince and ask for permission to stay. This
poses a considerable risk unless the thin-blood has a
highly-specialized skill set, or the city an unusually
open-minded Prince. Only vampires with little
to lose dare to openly flout social convention and
tastelessly consort with thin-blood scum. Some
Malkavians and Nosferatu particularly delight in
taking thin-bloods under their wings to flout social
norms, but too many such protégés draws the
Harpies’ disdain and social death.
<br/>
Most Mercurians opt to keep their heads down
and stick to the outskirts of the city, or to whatever
unpromising domain they have homesteaded. Thus
the Scourge often becomes a thin-blood coterie’s
main point of contact with the powers that be in a
Camarilla city. These enforcers of the Prince’s will
oscillate between threatening and guiding thin-blood
coteries to stay within the lines of the city’s traditions.
At best the coterie has to deal with a reluctant bully
who only makes an example out of them when
demanded by the Prince or the Primogen. At worst,
the Scourge is a violent butcher looking for any excuse
to tear the coterie, and its members, apart.
<br/>
The most insidious threat that faces a thin-blood
coterie when operating out of a Camarilla domain
is the allure of the Ivory Tower itself. The Camarilla
understands how difficult unlife can be without a
support system and they can offer a great deal to a
promising vampire who can brew elixirs or walk in
the sun or otherwise prove useful. The promise of an
easy unlife and being adopted into a real clan can be
hard to resist for those thin-bloods that have given up
on curing their condition. Such opportunities are rare
and a thin-blood coterie may find itself torn apart as
its members vie against each other for a chance to join
the Camarilla as a full member.

            Blood Destiny
        </h2>
        <p>
            Spending nights walking a thin line between mortal
and immortal proves challenging for many thinbloods. The choice between walking back to the sun
and losing their immortality or trying to strengthen
their blood and stain their soul hovers ever-present
in their minds. However, much like immortality,
achieving either of these options does not prove easy,
and may take decades.
<br/>
Developing a Project (p. 214) with the Storyteller
is an excellent way to start. It allows players to think
through and design how their character would turn
back to mortal or strengthen their blood, but it is not
the only way. You could build your entire chronicle
around trying to achieve either, or both, of these goals.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3>
            Finding The Sun
        </h3>
        <p>
            Players who want to explore trying to change their
blood back and finding their mortality again have
a chronicle-long goal ahead of them, and one well
worth investigating. Whether they pursue Golconda,
team up with a mortal mystic or clergyman, or
dive into ancient sorcerous lore or new alchemical
transformations they meet plenty of weird and
dangerous opposition while perhaps increasingly
doubting the value of becoming fragile and
vulnerable again.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>
            Strengthening the Blood
        </h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to strengthening their blood, the
Kindred know and fear the act of diablerie, drinking
from one’s elders. Getting opportunity for access to
a full-blood vein, much less permission, can prove
challenge enough for a chronicle. Many thin-blood
coteries form just to get revenge on the vampire who
made them by drinking him dry. But success carries
its own stigma: neither the Camarilla nor the Anarchs
approve of such actions even among other full-bloods.
<br/>
Kindred know of no other method, but very few Kindred know Thin-Blood Alchemy. Constant
experimentation, research, and inspiration has
already led to impossible elixirs and dangerous
formulae: can the True Red Elixir be far away?
Players and Storytellers should work together to
develop any ideas and plots the characters may want
to explore. Not every experiment works, but there is
always a chance it could succeed. These temporary
boosts could be enough to help a thin-blood pass
for full-blood Kindred within a sect, or to let them
surpass the sects entirely.
        </p>
        <h5>
            Not every character is going to want to walk these two
lines. The appeal of sex, drugs, rock and roll, and eternal
unlife can also drive a character to experiment upon
themselves for different reasons. Either way, visible
experimentation invites trouble of all kinds, and not just
for the character but for every thin-blood within reach.

            These Merits and Flaws only apply

            You never developed fangs, or the ones you’ve

            You are afflicted with the Beast equal to

        <h4>
            Branded by the Camarilla
        </h4>
        <p>
            In
some cities, the rulers simply hunt down and destroy
thin-bloods. In other cities,
the merciful Sheriff merely
brands them, forcibly and
painfully, to remind them of
their place. (Many are then
hunted down and destroyed,
often on perceived slights or
simple whims.) You have such
an unhealing brand, and the
Camarilla makes sure to keep its eyes peeled for the moment
you step out of line. You can
take Camarilla Contact with
this Flaw; the Camarilla thrives
on double-dealing of this sort.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Clan Curse
        </h4>
        <p>
            Remnants of your
sire’s Blood still flows through
your veins, carrying traces of
their ancient curse. You
must pick a Clan Bane
to suffer from, counting your Bane Severity
as 1 for this purpose.
You can only pick the

if you possess the Bestial

you have the Catenating

        <p>
            Your
            Blood is not strong
            enough to completely
            sustain you, and as
            an effect, your flesh
            is in a constant state
            of putrefaction, with
            a greenish tint and
            faint stench of rot.
            Any medical inspection will immediately
            identify you as deceased, and
            you receive a one-die penalty
            to any face-to-face Social test

    You
broke an unwritten rule or
thought yourself equal among
equals, where some turned
out more equal than others. In
whichever case, the Anarchs of
the regnum know of you and
shun you. They’d rather throw
you to the Camarilla than
listen to your pleas. You cannot
take Anarch Comrades if you

        </p>
        <h4>
            Vitae Dependency
        </h4>
        <p>
            Your Blood
is unable to sustain vampiric
powers by itself. Unless you
drink enough vampire Blood
to slake one Hunger each week
you lose your ability to gain
and use any Disciplines (including Thin-Blood Alchemy).
You regain your powers as soon
as you slake at least one Hunger
with vampire Blood.

        <h4>
            HeliopHoBia
        </h4>
        <p>
            An overly cautious Sire hammered the reminder
to avoid sunlight into you a little too hard, or you
saw someone catch fire in a sunrise early after your
Embrace. Either way, you fear sunlight as though
you were a full vampire. You are susceptible to terror
frenzy from sunlight.
        </p>
        <h4>
            nigHt terrors
        </h4>
        <p>
            You sleep as usual, with no memory of any of the
dreams you may have had during the day. However,
at night those dreams come flooding in at the most
inopportune times. During times of stress, or when
your Beast is strongest, nightmares pull through
and feel excruciatingly real. They may be disjointed
hallucinations, or they may be a way for the Storyteller to
feed theme or foreshadow events. Once per session, your
night terrors onset and you take a one-die penalty to all
actions for the rest of the scene.
        </p>
        <h4>
            plagUe Bearer
        </h4>
        <p>
            You are still susceptible to mortal sickness: colds, flu,
and other more severe infections. Every time you feed
you must roll a die for each Hunger slaked, and if any
come up a “1,” you’ve caught something nasty. (Effect
is up to the Storyteller, but could range from die
penalties to slow Health degradation.) Mortal medicine
doesn’t cure you; only drinking a functioning immune
system by slaking your Hunger to 0 does so. And of
course, you run the risk of infecting anyone you feed
on, using the same die roll as above.
        </p>
        <h4>
            sloppy drinker
        </h4>
        <p>
            Your bite is careless, or your fangs are ill suited
to puncture skin cleanly. When feeding, make a
Dexterity + Medicine test against a Difficulty equal
to Hunger slaked to cover your feed marks before
too much blood is spilled. On a failure, the wound
is too ragged to close: the mortal may bleed out with
Masquerade-threatening neck wounds.

            You cannot use Discipline powers – including ThinBlood Alchemy – in sunlight, and active powers

you avoid any hint of sunlight.

irritated, but they definitely clock you. Lose two dice
from Stealth pools and similar against supernatural

            tWiligHt presence
        </h4>
        <p>
            You make others uncomfortable around you. Most
mortals don’t want to be around you at all, and
other Kindred dislike you even more than they do
regular thin-bloods. Only thin-bloods can adjust to
your weird demeanor. Lose a die from Social pools
involving anyone except thin-bloods.

            Unending HUnger

        <p>
            Your Beast always hungers for more, never finding
            sustenance with smaller sips. When feeding in a
            scene you sate one less Hunger than other thinbloods. This applies only once per scene.

        <h4>
            Catenating Blood
        </h4>
        <p>
            You can create Blood
Bonds and perform the
Embrace as a regular vampire. Any vampire you create this
way will be a thin-blood.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Day Drinker
        </h4>
        <p>
            Sunlight halves
your Health tracker (rounded
up), but otherwise simply
removes your vampiric abilities, including all Disciplines
and Health benefits, and does
no other damage. You still
suffer from Hunger, however,
and sooner or later you’ll need
to sleep. If your health drops
below your currently sustained
damage levels as a result of this, you suffer the effects of
Impairment or torpor (depending on type of damage)
until you are clear of sunlight.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Discipline Affinity
        </h4>
        <p>
            You
have an affinity for a certain
Discipline, picked at character creation. You gain a dot
in this Discipline and can
learn and retain additional
dots in it through experience
expenditures, as if you were a
normal vampire. (The experience point cost is the same
as an out-of-clan Discipline.)
Drinking blood with matching Resonance does not reward you with any extra dots
in this Discipline, temporary
or not.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Lifelike
        </h4>
        <p>
            You have a heartbeat,
can eat food, and enjoy sexual
activities like a mortal. All but
the most advanced medical
inspections reveal nothing out
of the ordinary, assuming they
happen at night.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Thin-blood Alchemist
        </h4>
        <p>
            The
Duskborn change as they
feed. Thin-Blood Alchemy is
the mastery of this process.
Whether it is spontaneous
or a skill learned by comparing notes with other bloodcookers, you have gained one
dot and one formula (p. 282) in
Thin-blood Alchemy. You can
purchase additional dots and
formulae through experience
as usual.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Vampiric Resilience
        </h4>
        <p>
            You suffer
damage as a regular vampire,
treating regular puncture and
slashing wounds as Superficial
damage.
        </p>
        <h4>
            aBHorrent Blood
        </h4>
        <p>
            Something in your Blood makes other vampires unable
to stomach it. Whether it is the perverse mix of life and
undeath or your history of questionable Thin-Blood
Alchemy, other vampires gag and vomit when they
try to drink from you. Other vampires abort any bite attempts after the initial damage and anyone who tries
to keep drinking from you must spend two points
of Willpower each turn that they do so. Mortals and
Thin-Blood Alchemy are not affected by this anomaly.
        </p>
        <h4>
            FaitH-prooF
        </h4>
        <p>
            Whether you consider yourself an atheist or
devoutly religious, you remain too close to mortality
for True Faith to affect you.
        </p>
        <h4>
            loW appetite
        </h4>
        <p>
            When at Hunger 0 or 1, and when rising at sunset,
roll two dice on your Rouse Check and take the
highest of the two.
        </p>
        <h4>
            lUcid dreamer
        </h4>
        <p>
            Most vampires don’t dream because they don’t sleep.
You dream; you can recall and even sometimes control
your dreams. Once per session, if you’re asleep by day
you can ask the Storyteller to provide a clue from the
previous night’s memories or a hint about the story
suitable for dream revelation.
        </p>
        <h4>
            mortality’s mien
        </h4>
        <p>
            Your mortal nature still outshines your Beast. Your
aura does not appear vampiric or supernatural;
instead it looks mortal to anyone able to detect
supernatural creatures. You can also add two dice to
any attempt to make yourself appear mortal in other
regards, such as makeup.
        </p>
        <h4>
            sWiFt Feeder
        </h4>
        <p>
            Maybe you were a phlebotomist in life, or just didn’t
like mess. You sip delicately and quickly, neatly slaking
one Hunger in one turn, including licking the wound
closed. This Merit can only be used once per scene.
